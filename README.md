# DroneKit LA Test Data

## Sample logs and dronekit-la output

### When adding logs here:
 - Any log added to this repository must be done so with the permission of the owner of that log.
 - consider any sensitive information that may be present in the log
 - keep it short to make the repo usable - 5MB seems a reasonable general limit
 - please indicate the in the commit message whose logs they are

### When updating analyses:
 - make sure the output has only gotten better
 - ensure that the output hasn't changed because of a platform issue (e.g. precision of floats on output)
